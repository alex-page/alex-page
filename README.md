Hey, I'm Alex.

I write code that connects people to pixels. I build communities and create systems with modern technology and thoughtful design.

I lead multidisciplinary teams across 8+ timezones at [Shopify](https://shopify.com). I am working on the [Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com) – Shopify's open source design platform. Our team scales high quality, accessible and performant user experiences to thousands of developers and designers building the commerce platform for everyone.

I was the Lead User Experience Engineer on the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au). I worked in a team to align 1000+ websites over 200+ organisations.
